elviscera,3.0,Possibly better memory support than i9-13900K,05/04/2024,"Once they came down in price, I did get a i9-14900K as an ""upgrade"" from a i9-13900KF to  i9-14900K .  It's OK but I can't rave over it.  It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky.I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.  On the morning morning after, I had buyers remorse, tried to cancel but could not, so instead, I refused the package.  It took literally 6 months to get a refund.  That was rather irksome."
Chris,3.0,I finally lost,17/02/2024,"I've built computers for more than 20 years, and I have never in my life had so much trouble booting with stock bios settings. I think I finally lost the silicon lottery. Using an Asus mb, I had to go into bios limit voltage and manually tune each pcore. Temps were wild and out of control 100°c, clock speeds were low thermal throttling, random crashes, blue screens inability to run simple programs without them crashing and shutting down. Tried intel xtu auto overclocking, ai suite, and asus ai overclocking via bios.. none of that worked. Had to just dig into bios, set limits, and manually tune each core. Now system is stable and solid. Been benchmarking and stress testing for a few days now. Temps are great, and I am happy. Not sure if mb is culprit, gonna get another board and test the chip. Just be ready for some trouble. Looked over many forums of others having the same issues."
Cpu was not in the box as it was advertised. Cam in a cardboard box. Sealed in a plastic wrapped. Without instructions,3.0,"Regret, should have go AMD",03/05/2024,"Because of the crash problem and we are told to turn down the performance in the CPU, We are not getting the performance we paid for. INTEL is saying it's the motherboard, and the motherboard is saying it's INTEL. we are not getting what we paid for, I think they should recall and give us a refund 🤔 what a waste."
David Silva,3.0,"the prosesor came loose, tumbling inside the box all the wat to my country.",07/06/2024,i just got mad oved the tumbling issue. The performance of the processor is fine.
Mailyn Gonzalez,3.0,"Great when I first received it, then an update to the ME engine nerfed it.",09/03/2024,"I was really pleased with this processor in the beginning, was running it at 6.1Ghz as a daily driver and even 6.4Ghz. About a month or two in to owning it they released an Intel Management Engine update for this processor and that was it no more overclocks. Every game would now crash if the processor was overclocked. I am tired of playing cat and mouse with Intel, won't be buying a processor for a while until things drastically change."
Maul,3.0,Thermal throttle spikes not present with 13900k,03/01/2024,"My 13900k never thermal throttled in any game, yet I'm getting thermal throttle spikes when playing games like Cyberpunk with the 14900k. My 360 AIO mount is not the issue, as temps hover around 90-93c when stress testing at 253w. I'm also using a contact frame. I'm thinking the issue might be the increased voltage at the stock 5.7 all core frequencies, because my power usage has increased a lot while gaming. Whatever the case, I'm not the only one seeing this behavior - it's unacceptable.Update: Reducing the e-cores to 4.3 helps significantly, and setting everything to 5.5/4.3 (13900k values) solves it completely. Simply too much voltage is being pumped into the chip at stock frequencies. I've set up a Thermal Velocity Boost profile where 80c drops to 5.6, and 90c drops to 5.5, with e-cores at 4.3... and the issues are basically gone. Ridiculous that this has to be done though."
Joshua Woodard,3.0,Issues...,27/02/2024,"I had tons of issues with this cpu. I returned it and purchased elsewhere due to Amazon not having a replacement option or any available at the time for prime shipping. The one that I have now works great, so it's a good product if you get one that works.My second gripe with this cpu is that it's basically just a refresh of 13th gen without the luxury of working out of the box with z790 mobos. You will need to flash the bios of your mobo."
Mushatla,3.0,Poor Packaging,27/03/2024,
Lance C.,3.0,The heat is hot,20/03/2024,Super hot CPU. Investing in this means investing in serious cooling for it.
Brian Lees,1.0,Horrible Efficiency,03/04/2024,"overall intel is great for a work station, HOWEVER the 14 series is stupid as hell... it offers NO benefit in 99.9% of situations over 13 series... I upgraded from a 12700k, and saw only minor improvements, and at the expense of power cost. My desktop now idles at 150-250 watts... before with my 12700k it was idling at like half that. in most cases a lot of people wont care, however being forced to live in a high cost of living state like CA, where electricity is $0.44 per kwh, that means just idling is costing me 0.11 per hour, that's $1000 a year just in idling... plus all the electricity my house uses. I'm only here temporarily (military) and will be moving as soon as retire, but its something to note.On top of that, its a straight refresh of the older 13th gen, and they blocked APO for the 13th and 12th gen and aren't working on getting it working across the board (only minor useless titles no one honestly cares about)...If it was a bit cheaper to go AMD, I would have went to a 7800x3d, but that would have cost me about 900 just to switch, due to having to buy new RAM (still on DDR4, 3600mhz/CL14) and Motherboard...There's also the constant issue of certain games/programs just refusing to run in Multithread/Multicore, or using the E-cores inappropriately. Intel really needs to sort out this trash..."
Mark,1.0,BEWARE of the New LGA 1700 Socket,20/03/2024,"I've been a lifetime Intel diehard fan but man they really pushed a disappointing product out. This thing gets HOT, I've been building computers for a while but I've never seen a CPU regularly spike to 100 C with liquid cooling. My previous 8700k ran great and was fulling overclocked to 4.8GHz and I never saw anything higher than 78 C under 100% load. I was so sketched out by seeing the 14700k temps that I ran Intel's CPU diagnostic software and I couldn't even finish it! The temps got to a steady 93-100 C while testing so I had to cancel it and let the CPU cool down.I even tried some gaming with it and while playing Helldivers 2 at ""High/Medium"" settings It liked to hover at 95C and spiked constantly. This caused thermal throttling and game stutters followed with it. Even while at the desktop fully idle my temps would spike around from 25 C all the way up to 70 C. The reason for this is the new LGA 1700 socket ILM, you have to buy, replace, and correctly torque a WHOLE new socket brace just so you can kind of tame this CPU.I remember when Intel was known for keeping cool and AMD for getting hot. That's not the case anymore and I'm so disappointed because Intel was my go to with every single PC I ever built."
Rishi,3.0,Memory controller isn't that great,14/12/2023,It's no secret that the memory controller is a lottery on this and 13th gen cpus. It's very flaky.7200mhz XMP profiles are unstable. 4 sticks of RAM is unstable.Other than that the CPU does its job. It's basically just a binned 13900ks. Nothing special.
Mr. Fox,2.0,Poor Silicon Samples,22/04/2024,The one received was a silicon lottery loser that required excessive and abnormally high voltage and had horrible SP-ratings. It was returned because the poor silicon quality made it unsuitable for the purpose for which it was purchased. I purchased a 14900KF from Amazon to replace it and it was equally poor quality and had to go back. Intel needs to cull their trash samples and sell them at a lower price. A CPU that needs 1.500V to run stock turbo clocks is unacceptable and impossible to properly cool.
KTS,2.0,Gets uncontrollably hot,04/05/2024,"I have this CPU on an ASUS z790 Hero MB with a H150i 360mm AIO cooler. This cpu temp spikes and throttles like crazy under high load. Using Thermal Grizzly paste as well. I have built competition systems for over a decade. This is not normal... Been following the online ""declocking"" and ""undervolting"" and that is unacceptable."
Mr. Migraine,1.0,UPDATED: BSOD CPU: CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT,28/01/2024,"The media could not be loaded.
                



UPDATE: Been at this for days and days. Intel core i9-14900k on ASUS z790 Strix is a BSOD MACHINE. Previouslyit would run for many minutes. Now it barely goes one ir two minutes before freezing and a BSOD. Now I'm doing ASUS BIOS MemTest86 so far so good (for the RAM).While Windows 11 Pro was working I did the Memory Diagnostics and it said it passed. So either the CPU or the Motherboard is bad.New ASUS Z790 Strix, with new Intel i9-14900k, with new T700 2TB Gen5 PCIE 5 NVME M2, and new 64GB DDR5 6400 RAM, with Runs Windows 11 Pro. All drivers up and Windows are up to date.I've not done any overclocking or XMP in the bios to push the RAM 4000Mhz to the advertised 6400. I avoided buying RAM that can go 8000Mhz with XMP because there are so very many failures with those--and I wanted 8000 because I wanted a system with no bottlenecks as much as possible.Runs great for about 5 to 30 minutes. Temps run from 30s to 50s to high 80s bouncing up and down like normal. Then BOOM BSODs.I will do tests including memory, cpu, and double check drivers.Most websites point to a CPU issue. Some mention RAM or drivers.I'm either going to solve this issue or return this i9-14900 CPU and replace it with an i9-13900.I hope to remember this review and update it with success info."
SHL1,1.0,BUYER BEWARE,03/05/2024,I have written a couple of dozen reviews on Amazon and this is only my second negative review.  I placed an order for a brand new Intel 14700K CPU from Amazon and it arrived as an Open Box (the factory seal had been cut and the processor was jammed into the packaging at an odd angle.  I installed it in my system and it would not boot - did not even get past the POST testing.  I uninstalled it and send back for a refund with a note that it was an open box and was defective.I give this only a single star across all categories as the processor arrived in an open box (I paid full price for a new CPU) and did not work in my system (it was defective on arrival) - it's a month later and I still have not received a refund.  I purchased an identical CPU from another source and that CPU booted up with no issues (it is running the PC I am typing this review on) so clearly an issue with the quality of the product that Amazon shipped to me.
Eric Heuyard,1.0,Series known to have issues,31/05/2024,"The 13th and 14th gen intel cpu chips are notorious for being unstable and low quality. While installation is easy, the chip may come with deficiencies that get worse over time.For the first couple months after install i would experience BSoD crashes and i was trying to diagnose. Now 2 months later the computer will no longer boot without BSoD. All other hardware has been replaced meaning the chip is absolutely the issue. Currently in the process of RMA negotiations with intel because diagnosis took longer than the amazon return window. So far their service has been slow to respond. Until intel admits to the faults in these generations and offers an actual fix i would suggest sticking to AMD. I wish i had.I personally never overclocked the card, never had the chance, it wasn't very stable on default settings. Had a ticket with intel since 3 days ago, they havent reaponded in 2 days. Buyer be ware..."
Ryan's Reviews,2.0,Can't overclock with thermal throttle,21/02/2024,"I've got an Arctic freezer II, and direct contact place to try and cook this thing off but it's too hot. I had the underclock the voltage for my CPU in the BIOS to get this thing to not overheat while exporting Adobe videos. Intel missed the mark here and I'm pretty mad I can't return it. It works fine doing normal tasks, and gaming, but when I want a 3D render something or encode/export a video then it will thermal throttle at 100° C with fans at max speed. It literally spikes up to 100 in like one second."
Justin,2.0,Smh,05/05/2024,"I was thinking, i am building my first major rig and wanted a beast of a processor. Wiff. this thing has the stability of someone on a unicycle on a tramploine. somedays its all good, others.. well i think you can imagine."
Shades 2000,1.0,Would be a great CPU but mine defective but it still booted and acted fine at first.,02/06/2024,"System booted  fine with 2 ram sticks installed and it appeared that everything was fine at first but after some time issues started to show up.  Unfortunately this did not happen until the 30 day return policy elapsed.  At first I thought it was the motherboard or RAM.  But testing of different RAM ruled that out.  Bios updates to the motherboard did not help the issue.  Putting in a known good CPU allowed the final test of the motherboard and original system RAM and that all passed which indicates a issue with the CPU.  Now I'm waiting for Intel RMA process to have them test the CPU again and hopefully replace it.  When I did not have issues, it was a fast CPU, very impressed with that, just wish this showed up sooner."
Kinuyo,1.0,"unstable, has known issues",01/07/2024,"Bought this, worked great for about a week, then i started to get BSOD's, games and other programs crashing etc. I changed out the RAM, the Motherboard, GPU and even power supply because i couldn't believe the CPU was bad.... guess what it was the CPU.  They replaced it after fighting and the same issues happened again after a few days.  I never got the temp over 80c, this i9 has been having issues across the world and Intel refuses to to a product recall and actually fix it.  This might be the last intel CPU i buy."
Mauricio,3.0,Caja cortada con un cúter,25/10/2023,"La caja tenía un corte de cúter en la parte superior, la verdad me molesta que haya tan poco cuidado con las cajas de productos tan caros."
Amazon Customer,1.0,AVOID THIS PROCESSOR AT ALL COSTS / 13th/14th gen Intel i7-i9 issues,13/04/2024,"Where do I begin... In between the stability issues this causes, the blue screens of death, the fact that you can't run even Minesweeper due to the problems this processor causes, the ""lack of video resources"" not caused by the GPU but rather by the CPU, the constant need for undervolting of a so-called high end chip, the overheating of the processor, the fact that Intel stayed quiet about this and STILL hasn't taken any action so far, that so many customers have been forced to ask for returns, or the fact that this was hushed for so long that it'll be a miracle to get a refund... Disappointment is still too light a term to refer to what went on with these processors. Honestly, this already falls within a product recall territory, and it's both a scam and an insult to every potential customer out there."
dino,1.0,Defective from manufacturer constant game crashes because of power throttle issue.,02/06/2024,Defective from manufacturer constant game crashes because of power throttle issue. Intel needs to recall this product and refund everyone.  I replaced every part on my new PC build only to find out the issues was this Intel CPU (amazon 30 day warranty had already expired by then).  I'm now having to wait for months attempting to get a refund from intel.  This is a well-known issue and Intel refuses to admit and recall product
Kal,1.0,Lost me as a customer,19/03/2024,"I’ve always used Intel, as my experiences with AMD have never been great. Wanted to upgrade from my 8700K as I’m doing a lot more rendering/3D work and I need the extra cores and performance. I thought I did my due diligence and picked out ram that was compatible with my motherboard, a suitable CPU cooler, etc to ensure a smooth upgrade.Ultimately was met with so much instability, crashes, high power usage and heat. The instability seemed incurable so I returned everything and switched to the 7950x3d… and it just worked straight out of the box, runs so much cooler and less power draw, with no crashes. It’s not as fast as the 14900k in my tasks, but the other benefits out weigh the decrease in performance."
Nathan,1.0,A Carefully Engineered Nightmare,17/04/2024,"I'm a game developer and decided to switch from AMD to Intel for my latest build. The amount of problems this CPU has caused me has cost me hundreds of hours of work. I've been building computers for over 20 years and this is by far the absolute worst component of all time. E cores will cause instability in almost every multithreaded application, clocking has to be severely limited to avoid blue screen of death, Intel Extreme Tuning Utility is borderline malware, and the high thread count is just deceptive marketing because 1/3 of the cores are laptop grade. It gave the illusion of stability through the return period so I'm now stuck with a $500 paper weight CPU and motherboard."
HB,1.0,"Absolute scam, stay away!",18/05/2024,"This CPU is a scam. I spent four months debugging my new system, went through three motherboards, two sets of RAM and countless hours of debugging and trying, just to figure out that this CPU is garbage. I can't get my system stable, it keeps failing. This CPU is so overclocked that it does not run stable. Ever. Safe your money, times and nerves and stay as far away from this CPU as you can. I will never buy Intel again."
Wolfkill,2.0,No thermal paste?,02/03/2024,"Ive bought AMD for a long time, this is my first time trying intel and seeing no thermal paste is like a spit in the face."
K. Promesse,1.0,Defective,28/06/2024,"I think I may have gotten a defective CPU because the processor doesn't work, installer tried three different motherboards to rule out pcie failure on board, and tested with different ram, could not get through booting to windows without BOD'ing."
David Davidson,1.0,A blazingly hot unstable piece of trash,16/06/2024,"This thing is unstable and intel knows it, can’t run it above base profiles or it crashes constantly and intel still doesn’t know how to fix it. Everyone who bought this overpriced room heating device should be refunded at once"
Clayton,1.0,Tribal packaging,05/06/2024,Products work well but runs very hot. Tribal packaging tho the only Protection was a piece of crumpled paper. The cpu wasn't even in the packaging it had folen out and was just tumbling around the box when it arrived. luckily didn't have any noticeable damage though
Jp,1.0,Unstable chips,13/06/2024,Ive tried both 13900k and 14900 k and have had issues with everything crashing games applications. I have changed multiple motherboard’s and ram kits very unstable. Dont recommend and or wish this stressful and painful struggle to anyone. I have tried many things and nothing absolutely nothing works
Sarah Lucas,1.0,Incredibly unstable,27/04/2024,"Intel has pushed these 13th and 14th Gen i9's way too far in an effort to keep up with AMD. They come out of the box with maxed out settings, including a nearly unlimited 5000w (yes, thousand) available power draw. Intel customer support will ask you to manually configure the BIOS to a setting that effectively renders it a very expensive i7. Wait until they get this fixed, if it's even possible, unless you just really like underclocking and BSODs"

Andre Lup,1.0,SO MANY PROBLEMS,17/05/2024,This CPU is a piece of garbage. Can’t run most games without special settings that are all different from each other depending on the game. Don’t buy this worthless CPU. Was better off sticking with my 10th gen I7
Kindle Customer,1.0,Unstable Out Of The Box.,20/05/2024,"Installed on an Asus Z790 Hero motherboard, the system was unstable when attempting to undervolt the CPU, and tweaking settings never stabilized it. Hopefully, Intel will release more stable silicon in their next generation."

Justin,1.0,Was a loyal intel consumer until this.,07/05/2024,Brand new chip doesn’t even work. How’d are these for sale? Returned this. Amazon received this almost one month ago and still hasn’t issued a refund.
Erebus,1.0,Windows install wants a network but no network is listed,30/12/2023,"While you are installing windows, when you get stuck on finding a network but no networks are listed and it won't let you continue. This is because Windows 11 doesn't support your built in LAN/Wi-Fi drivers.The solution for this is to hitShift+F10 which will bring up the command prompt window. From here you typeOOBE\BYPASSNRO which will re-enable the ""I don't have internet"" option.This will let you continue installing windows.Now you can troubleshoot your network from windows."

Shelly Morgan,1.0,Do not buy,21/10/2023,This thing is a total scam from the i9 13900k or kf. It’s literally the same thing. The advertise that its goes up to 6000hz but that’s only on two cores of course and only when you don’t need them do they go that high. I had higher cinebench scores on my i9 13900kf then I did on this processor. It’s the same thing just overclocked out of the box. Save your money

Christopher,1.0,i9 CPU Instability and Degradation - Buyer Beware,19/05/2024,"purchased the i9 CPU six months ago with high expectations for top-tier performance. Initially, it lived up to those expectations, running smoothly for about four months. However, my experience took a turn for the worse when instability issues began to plague my system.Games started crashing randomly to the desktop, and I encountered frustrating VRAM errors in Fortnite, which are known issues with 13th and 14th gen i9 CPUs. I soon realized that my motherboard's default settings were likely to blame, as they inadvertently cooked my CPU, causing it to degrade rapidly over a short period. Despite my efforts to disable overclocking features like ASUS Multicore Enhancement, the motherboard continued to apply overclocks, exacerbating the problem.In response to widespread complaints, Intel and motherboard manufacturers released BIOS updates touted to fix the issue by reducing power limits, known as the Intel Baseline Defaults profile. Initially, this seemed to restore stability to my system, but the respite was short-lived. After about a month, the same issues resurfaced, casting doubt on the effectiveness of the solution.I am currently dealing with Intel support over this CPU, and I have a case number with them as we work to resolve the ongoing issues. The fact that these issues are still ongoing and Intel is actively investigating the root cause speaks to the severity and complexity of the problem.Based on my experience and the prevalence of similar issues, I urge potential buyers to think carefully before investing in the i9 CPU. Considering the reported stability of i7 CPUs, it may be a safer choice for those prioritizing reliability."
Anna,1.0,CPU is defective,15/06/2024,"Overall, the 14900 is insanely good CPU, but I have to rate it 1 star, because I got defective CPU (can't play any game, it crashes all the time).Can't even return or replace because the order is not from USA, and I got the item very late and return windows is already closed.Thought Intel announcing that the 13 & 14th I9 have manufacturing defect would help. Talked with live support, but they don't care at all (they just say return windows is closed)."
shane,1.0,Crashes doesn't work stay away from intel,02/07/2024,"very unstable they claim its only with some games, but it's not true stay away really wish I didn't get this CPU slower and no blue screens of death would have been better then something not usable."

EKing708,1.0,Do NOT buy 14th Gen i9's,30/04/2024,"Hey all,I built my most recent rig with the following specs:CPU: i9-14900kMotherboard: MSI Carbon WiFi II Z-790RAM: 64 gig rip jaw low profile (certified compliant by MSI)Cooler: Dark Rock Pro 5GPU: ROG 4070Ti SuperPower Supply: Rog Thor 850w PlatinumCase: Corsair 4000DThis rig should be a monster, but because Intel has misled the general public, it is completely unstable and blue screens multiple times per day. These 14th-generation chips are trash. They are fraught with instability issues, and the news worsens as time progresses. We have been through three motherboards, three different sets of RAM, and two different GPUs, and the problems continue.Now, I have to decide if I can be without my rig for several weeks to try to RMA the chip via Intel. The worst part of all this is a crap shoot if I receive an actual working chip back. Again, it does not appear to be the chip itself but the instruction/algorithm Intel uses.Motherboard manufacturers are allowing these chips, by default, to run off the rails. Intel's power spec is 253W. When I checked the BIOS on my motherboard(s), they come by default set to run at just under 5000W! Are you kidding me? If you are not a really good problem solver with these things. I do not see the average consumer having any understanding of why their rig is acting like a crazy person.Anyway, just do yourselves a favor and take a big ol' pass on these chips. They are not worth it. Stick with your old chips until the next gen comes out or just switch over to AMD.@Intel; you have to stop being the Boeing of the Chip world. You were once a great company with high standards, and now you are just imping for your shareholders. Get it together, and start doing things right. This concludes this review of the core i9-14900k, best wishes on your journeys."
gayle price,1.0,I9 14900k not up to par,19/04/2024,"Did a pc build and kept getting crashes. PC repair tech tested all hardware and determined the cpu caused the problems. All hardware compatible with each other as confirmed before buying/assembling. Unfortunately this was discovered 4 days after being able to return to Amazon. Intel contacted for warranty, no reply yet. WAIT TO BUY till Intel fixes the bugs in this cpu."
RP,1.0,Intel store is horrible,14/03/2024,This company needs to be put to bed. Not only are they significantly behind on development but even when you order something from them it’s significantly delayed. My order took a whole week just to ship.
Lyric Morris,N/A,N/A,01/12/2023,Not buying a cpu from this seller again wen my order came I opened the box and the cpu was not in the box even tho it still has the factory seal wast of almost 1k bucks

狙撃犯Cチーム,N/A,N/A,08/05/2024,評判通りゲーム落ちます。ただしっかりとbiosやグラフィック設定をすることで問題は解消されますが少なくとも初めて組む人向けではないです。それでも欲しい人はしっかり設定の勉強しましょう。
SaK,N/A,N/A,03/02/2024,紙袋に入って届きました。精密機器のかなり高い物なのに相変わらずの雑な梱包はさすがにドン引きする。こういった精密機器はAmazonで買うのは本当におすすめしません。MBを買った時もでかい紙袋。メモリも買った時も紙袋。もちろんM.2も。手軽さからAmazonで購入しましたが考えを改める必要がありますね。やむを得なくAmazonで購入する際はメーカー直売や、お店から直接発送される物を選んで購入しましょう。使用レビューは性能は13genから唯一UPしてる14geni7。4070tiと一緒に使ってますが作業、ゲームどちらも快適です。14genが最後のiシリーズと聞いて購入しました。どうせGPUを取り付けるので、F付きにしました。セールで1万程安く購入してさらにKより安い為断然お得です。安く済むに越した事はないので、その分GPUに予算を割くことを強くおすすめします。グラフィック機能付きはGPUがイカれた時に助かる事は助かりますが、私の場合は過去にGPUがイカれた時にそもそもCPUだけでできる事は限られていた為、結果新しいGPUを購入するまでPCは使いませんでした。その経験を活かし今ではミドルスペックくらいのGPUを一つ予備に購入しました。F付きの難点はGPUがないとBIOSどころか、画面すらつかない為、新しく自作する場合や初めての自作に挑戦する方は、購入する順番を考えないと動作確認が出来ませんので、そこだけ気をつけましょう。商品的には満足ですが、発送方法がまずいので⭐︎3で。
lukino,N/A,N/A,13/06/2024,"Venditore inaffidabile, ho fatto 3 resi su questo venditore perchè i processori che ho ordinato avevano dei difetti ma non solo, aveva anche una specie di marchio quadrato all'esterno come se fosse stato ristampato il marchio, cosi contatto Intel e mi dicono che è molto strano questo e decidono di fare una sostituzione che non ho chiesto ma che ringrazio comunque, e all'arrivo del processore sostituito direttamente da Intel noto che questo stampo quadrato è diverso praticamente non esiste, la levigatura sul prodotto era differente.. Che dire, sono sempre rivenditori. Io ve lo sconsiglio."
Nick Gallant,N/A,N/A,03/05/2024,"I have had soooo many stability issues it is unreal.  I originally purchased the i9 13900k, did no overclocking but had soooo much trouble with the system that I stupidly replaced the mainboard and video card.  I didn't refund as I assumed that I had done the damage.  Literally months of troubleshooting and doubled expenses before I realized that the asus mainboard defaulted to super high wattage and the chip itself began to degrade at an extremely fast rate.  Yet again assuming that I must have done something wrong I ordered this replacement chip, to find issues suddenly occuring again.  This is about when the news dropped on mainboard suppliers and intel passing the buck on an inherently co dependant series of faults that have personally cost thousands upon thousands of dollars.I'm an IT professional, have been in the industry for more than 20 years, and have never encountered a situation so costly for the end consumer.I really hate to say it, I hold stocks in intel, I've loved them as a brand and considered them to be a number one choice, I can no longer say this.I honestly think there should be a class action lawsuit over this chip and it's predecessorI had to purchase 2  rtx 4090 and 2 asus mainboards before I could even lock down this issue.I hate to say it but if I'd gone with a competitor I would have saved multiple thousands of dollars."

インディペンデンス,N/A,N/A,23/01/2024,シンプルに！性能・安定感は満足です。i9のK付きモデルを視野に入れるのであれば、ベンチでもそこまでの性能差が出ないので13世代の同じもののほうがコスパは良いかもしれない。OCしても、13世代と性能差は感じられない...。
Amazon Kunde,N/A,N/A,04/05/2024,"Als es einen Monat und zwei Tage alt war,als ich Ai overclocked  trat Rauch auf, ich zog am PC-Kabel und hinterließ zwei Spuren auf meinem Motherboard. (Asus z690 Maximus extreme )  jetzt habe neuer motherboard und CPU bestellt , ich empfehle keinen"

Fernando Moreno,N/A,N/A,28/05/2024,"El producto era de importación, entiendo que pudieran haber abierto la caja, pero llegó incluso con restos de pasta térmica, por lo que debió haber sido usado o era uno que regresaron. La incógnita de no saber que tanto estrés se le metió al procesador antes de enviarlo es complicada, cuando se esperaba un producto nuevo.Actualización: El procesador en efecto venía dañado, el primero problema fue que impedía la instalación de Windows. La forma de verificar la falla fue entrando a la BIOS y desactivando todos los cores, a posterior fui activando uno por uno. Con un solo núcleo permitió instalar Windows, el resumen fue: todos los E-cores funcionaban, de los P-Cores estaban dañados el 4, 6 y 7 ya que al encender cualquiera de esos tres desde la BIOS, generaba pantallas azules, se freezeaba o cerraba programas aleatoriamente.No descarto que el tema haya sido un problema de fábrica, pero desde que llegó con pasta térmica en los bordes, me hacía sospechar que había algo malo con el procesador, ya se realizó la solicitud de reembolso."
Amazon Kunde,N/A,N/A,31/03/2024,"Verpackung beschädigt, CPU war gebraucht und defekt. Warte seit 2 Wochen auf Erstattung des Betrags."
